# WooDNSword

A free, floating domain name system

### How it works

The WooDNSword backend consists of two separate programs:

+ The **relay** is a daemon that clients and servers connect to, and handles the
  administration, registration, deregistration, and lookups of all domains.
  This program is meant to always be running, and ties the WooDNSword system
  together. Outside of allowing server-registered domains, the relay can itself
  reserve domains to reduce load and ensure uptime of a registered domain.

+ The **server** is another daemon that connects to a relay and registers any
  number of domains with the relay. When the connection is lost or the server
  disconnects, all registered domains are relinquished until they are
  reclaimed.
 
WooDNSword clients send requests to a relay for a response containing certain
information about a domain.
